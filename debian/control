Description: reusable core scripts for the Grml system
 This package includes some core scripts for the Grml system.
 .
 Currently, this package includes code2color, cpu-screen, ip-screen
 and lesspipe.sh, a more full-featured replacement for the standard
 Debian lesspipe.
 .
 This package can be used on plain Debian systems as well. It is
 intended as a complement to grml-etc-core.
 .
 For more details take a look at the grml-scripts-core manpage.
